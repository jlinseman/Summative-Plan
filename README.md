# Summative-Plan
Summative Game : UNO
Game Rule
Requires  2 or more players to win 
A standard 108 card UNO deck is required 
Each players will receive 7 cards from the deck and the rest of the deck lies face down in the middle
Take turns when playing the game
Place your card down when it’s your turn and you can only place when the cards have same colour or number
Special card to know about are, Reverse : reverses the order of player turns, Draw two cards : next player in turn draws two card from the deck, Skip card : skips the next player's turn, Wild card : the  player may choose any color they wish and place it bending the game's original rules, Wild draw four : it does the same thing as the wild card but it also makes the next player draw 4 cards from the deck
If you don't have any cards you can place you must draw 1 card from the deck and if you still can’t place then it's the next player's turn
If you have 1 card remaining and you can place it down you win
